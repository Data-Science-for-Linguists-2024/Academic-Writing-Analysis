## **Bree's Project Plan: Changes in American English Academic Writing over time** 

#### A Brief Summary: 
For my project, I would like to investigate how academic writing in American English has changed in the last few decades. I am still determining the criteria that I would use for this analysis.

#### The Data: 
I am still looking for a suitable dataset to use for this project, however I am looking for something reasonably sized that contains data that spans many years (hopefully decades) so that I can make comparisons over time.

#### The Goal: 
My goal is to be able to determine notable changes in American Academic writing over the past few decades, I anticipate that I will have to study recently observed and/or anticipated changes in academic writing on my own and then use data to support my findings. This could include measuring word type and token frequency, for example I could focus on how the use of different affixes have changed over time, etc.
